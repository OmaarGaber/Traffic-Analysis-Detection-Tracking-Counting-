# 🚗 Vehicle Detection & Tracking Using YOLOv8 + SimpleTracker

This project implements real-time vehicle detection, tracking, and counting using [YOLOv8] (https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and a custom IoU-based tracker. It focuses on cars, motorcycles, trucks, and buses and uses real-time video processing using OpenCV.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 **Object Detection** using YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt`) for fast and accurate detection.
- 🎯 **Class-Specific Filtering** (Cars, Motorcycles, Buses, Trucks).
- 🧠 **SimpleTracker** for object tracking using Intersection-over-Union (IoU) instead of a deep learning-based tracker.
- 🔄 **Object Identity Preservation** across frames.
- 📈 **Vehicle Counting** based on objects crossing a virtual horizontal line.
- 🖼️ **Live Visualization** with bounding boxes, labels, and movement trails.
- ⚡ Optimized for performance and can run on CPU or GPU.

## 🚦 How It Works

### 1. **Detection**
- Uses `yolov8n.pt` model to detect objects in the frame.
- Only detects vehicle-related classes from the COCO dataset (IDs: 2, 3, 5, 7).

### 2. **Tracking**
- A lightweight IoU-based tracker assigns a persistent ID to each detected vehicle.
- Tracks vehicles across multiple frames using bounding box overlap.

### 3. **Counting**
- A horizontal red line is drawn at 70% of the frame height.
- When a vehicle crosses the line **from below**, it's counted.
- Avoids recounting the same ID using a set of `counted_ids`.

### 4. **Visualization**
- Bounding boxes color-coded per class.
- Object IDs and class names shown above each box.
- Movement trails for visual understanding of motion.
